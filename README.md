# Trigonometry Solver

Trigonometry Solver is a simple command-line program that can be, as the name implies, used to solve Trigonometry questions. This is a remake of a program that I wrote in PowerShell back in grade 12 when I was bored in my Math course.

This program is relatively old now and I'm only really updating it just to fix a few things that are bugging me and properly structure the directory.
